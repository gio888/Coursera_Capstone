# Introduction/Business Problem
The COVID-19 pandemic has taken an unprecedented toll globally, already affecting over 2M people, taking over 200K lives and, according to WEF, will likely cost the world 2 trillion USD in economic losses.

In the Philippines, the responsibility of managing the quarantine falls on the shoulders of cities and municipalities, which are run by mayors.

Not all cities are affected by the virus the same way. Some cities are overwhelmed by the number of cases. Some cities have seen the peak and are now slowly coming down in terms of cases. Some cities are growing in terms of number of cases.

The mayors will be interested to see where their city is relative to cases. Is there city on the downward path or in the growth path?

This is the problem we want to solve with data analysis.

# Data Section
For this exercise, we will be using the cases dataset provided by the Philippine Department of Health. We will also use the Foursquare API to provide us with city location details.
